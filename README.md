# 🎓 KNI
**KAMAR Notices Interface**

**KNI** is a way to access notifications from the **[KAMAR](https://kamar.nz)** portal software in a large variety of different languages.

The goal of this project is to create an easy to use interface in as many languages as we can to make it easy for anyone to integrate **[KAMAR](https://kamar.nz)** notices into their applications or just use it for whatever purpose they want.

All source code for this project is open source and available on GitHub.
